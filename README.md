### Authors: Sammi Zhu, Isabel Xue, Trinh Nguyen, Megan Ong
Overview

This project is a comprehensive and interactive visualization that captures the evolution of the top fashion brands in the United States over the past decade. Our goal is to illuminate the shifts in consumer preferences and highlight key fashion trends that have shaped the industry. By leveraging a visually engaging and data-driven approach, we aim to provide meaningful insights that appeal to both academic researchers and industry professionals.

Objectives

Consumer Behavior Analysis: Explore how consumer preferences have shifted over time and the driving factors behind these changes.

Industry Trends: Identify the dominant brands and analyze their growth trajectories, offering a historical perspective on industry evolution.

Interactive Learning: Engage users through clickable data points that encourage deeper exploration of the information presented.

Design Philosophy
The design of our project is inspired by the aesthetics and storytelling format of a fashion magazine. Each "page" of the visualization unfolds like a magazine spread, inviting users to flip through and uncover insights. Our goal is to create a visually striking yet intuitive interface that merges fashion industry allure with robust data analytics.

Interactivity

A key feature of this project is its interactivity. Users are not passive viewers; instead, they can:

Click on Data Points: 
Each data visualization element is clickable.
Dynamic Visual Elements: 
Hover effects, animations, and transitions enhance the visual appeal while providing additional context for each data point.
Customizable Views: Users can adjust parameters, such as timeframes or brand categories, to tailor their exploration to specific interests.
Motivation

Our motivation stems turning raw data into a fashionable visualization. 

By making data exploration engaging and intuitive, we hope to encourage both academic and professional audiences to draw actionable insights.
